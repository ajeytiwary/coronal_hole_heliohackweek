Extra Information for `general_full_cadence.pro`, `kconcol.pro`, and `what_euvi.pro`

Angelos Vourlidas: "The main routine is `general_full_cadence.pro` but it is setup to go over a set of times and wavevelenghts. The gist of the code start in line 44 through 71. The rest is for populating the fits and png directories. If I recall correctly, the only difference for EIt are the weights for variable k"
